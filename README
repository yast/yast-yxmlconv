ycpxml2ruby

Intro
-----

yast2-core, since approx version 2.15.8, has the ability to transform
YCP into and XML representation. This is based on the abstract syntax
tree built up by the scanner/parser of libycp.

The 'ycpc' CLI tool can be instructed (with the '-x' parameter) to output
XML instead of yast bytecode.


Usage
-----

'convert.rb' is the main file for the converter

ycpc -c -x code.ycp -o code.xml

ruby convert.rb code.xml > code.rb


Files
-----

block.rb
  Handling everything within <block>...</block>

convert.rb
  main()

expressions.rb
  Handling expressions

helper.rb
  Helper functions

listener.rb
  Main rexml stream listener class

output.rb
  Output handler
  Cares for proper indentation and comment placing

statements.rb
  Handling statements

symbols.rb
  Handling symbol declarations


ToDo
----

The ycp scanner throws comments away. These should be made available
to the XML code and re-appear in the Ruby output.

YCP variable names might clash with Ruby keywords.

Implement builtins, like 'bracket', etc.
